# Description:  
This microsite helps the holiday shopper with different gift ideas. Along the right side within the hero banner there is a jQuery plugin carousel called [Flexslider by WooThemes - http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/) which rotates between different categories and shows some of the gifts available. The navigation on the bottom has links to the different categories in the carousel. Below that are links to social graphics and gift tags which can be downloaded by shoppers to use on their gifts.
